# Quantum Edge Detection

This repository includes Mathematica code and supplementary files used in our paper *Edge Detection* (https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11373).

## Description

An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use.


Our paper introduces Quantum Edge Detection (QED), a quantum protocol for identifying the boundaries of quantum domains where all particles share the same pure state. Focusing on a one-dimensional string of particles, we develop an optimal QED protocol and efficiently compute its success probability using Schur-Weyl duality and Semidefinite Programming (SDP) techniques. We analyze how the success probability depends on the string length and local dimension, with particular emphasis on the limit of long strings. We also present a protocol based on square root measurement, which we prove to be asymptotically optimal. Additionally, we explore a mixed quantum change point detection scenario, where the particle state transitions from known to unknownâ€”a framework with potential applications in detecting malfunctions in quantum devices.  

SDP is now a standard optimization technique implemented in various platforms, including Python, MATLAB, and Mathematica. Given Eq. (15) and the expressions for the Gram matrix in Eq. (48) (Appendix B), implementing the code to optimize the QED protocol is straightforward, so we do not provide it here.  

However, computing the asymptotic performance of the Square Root Measurement (SRM) protocolâ€”particularly deriving the Taylor series expansion for P(x) in Eq. (53), with coefficients listed in Tables 3â€“6â€”is more complex and computationally intensive. This is the focus of this repository. The Mathematica notebook **PertExp.nb** contains the relevant code.  

For completeness, we also include files with additional expansions.
